## Introduction
Ultimatestacker is a simple yet powerful stacking plugin for Minecraft that allows you to stack mobs, items, spawners and blocks on your server all with a single plugin. This allows for the reduction of lag from large amounts of mobs walking around and in mob grinders, items floating on the ground, large aounts of placed spawners in grinders, and also allows you to remove randomly placed block towers in your builds and turn them in to a single block. The plugin stores all the mobs, items, spawners and blocks, and displays a single entity along with a hologram above the entity that allows you to see how many entities are in that particular stack. This functionality is sure to keep your players coming back because of the high entity caps with reduced lag.
